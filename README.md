## Description

### Story
In Cat Destroy, an all-powerful cat destroys a bug, a can, a fish, a car, a house, the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun. I thought it would be fun to have a cat main character and give it the super ability to destroy random objects, and so this project was created. 

### Menu
When the user first opens the game, a calm song begins to play and they see a drawing (made by me :D) of the main cat character of Cat Destroy holding/destroying both the Earth and the Sun. The menu screen features start, options, and quit, which the player can cycle through using the up and down arrow keys. Upon clicking enter on their chosen text, the according action is taken. If the user choses start, the game will start. If the user choses options, they will be led to an options screen where they can mute the music by clicking the m key or unmute the music by clicking the u key. To leave the options, the user needs to click backspace. When the user choses quit, the application closes. 

### Game
In my short 2D video game, the player controls a cat head sprite with either the WASD keys or the arrow keys (their choice!). They are free to move the sprite around within the confines of the screen, and when they come into contact with randomly placed objects an explosion sound effect will play and said object will disappear off screen. A new object will spawn in a new random spot, and the player must once again destroy it. This process continues until all the objects are destroyed and a thank you message appears on the screen. The player can exit the game at any time by pressing esc or clicking the x in the top right of the window.

### Files
All the files used for my game are inside the src folder. I have eleven .png files which contain my drawings for the cat sprite, the backgrounds, and the objects that appear in the game. I also have two .mp3 files which contain the explosion sound effect and the game's music. I also have my .py files. There are three .py files in my folder, game.py, menu.py, and project.py. Game.py contains the code for my game's loop as well as associated variables, if statements, and functions that I need in order to run the game. Menu.py contains the code for my game's menu, including features like the background, music, options, and quit button. Project.py contains my main function which starts the game loop, and allows the user to play the game. It also contains three additional functions where I use cowsay to explain that most of my code is in menu.py and game.py. 

### Future
In the future I would love to extend the gameplay of Cat Destroy and make it even more complex with added features like timers and constantly moving objects which make it harder for the player (and by extension the cat) to destroy stuff. I could also improve on my sprites and give them each their own unique animations to make the game more lively.
