Cat-Destroy

## Description
My final project will be a short game where you play as an all-powerful cat who destroys all the objects it comes into contact with. This is relevant to media and digital arts because video games are a huge part of digital arts, and many people (including myself) are in this course in order to learn more about how to make games.  

## Features
- Main Menu
	- I will create a main menu so the player isn't immediately thrown into the game. It will give the player three choices, play, options, and quit. This will be done using seperate functions for a main menu screen, options screen, and game screen. I will add clickable buttons so the player can chose between the options.
- Player Movement 
	- The player will be in control of a cat sprite which can move around the screen using the WASD keys. 
- Destruction on Contact
	- When the player's cat sprite comes into contact with an obect in the game, the object will disappear from the screen. 
- Randomly Spawned Objects
    - When the player's cat spirte destroys all the items on screen, a new set of items will spawn in random positions. 
- Music & Sound Effects
	- A song will be added to the main menu of the game using Pygame's mixer. The song will change to a different one for the main gameplay, and there will be in-game sound effects for the destruction of objects.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome for my project is a game where there is a functioning menu screen with three functioning buttons (play, options, and quit), a playable game where the player moves around a cat sprite and runs into randomly spawned objects to destroy them. These objects will progressively get bigger and bigger, going from items like simple mouse toys to entire planets. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essential outcome for my project is a game where the player can move around as an all-powerful cat, and all the objects that come into contact with said cat disappear from the screen.
