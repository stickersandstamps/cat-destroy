## Description

### Story
In Cat Destroy, an all-powerful cat destroys a bug, a can, a fish, a car, a house, the Moon, the Earth, and the Sun. I thought it would be fun to 

### Menu
When the user first opens the game, a calm song begins to play and they see a drawing (made by me :D) of the main cat character of Cat Destroy holding/destroying both the Earth and the Sun. The menu screen features start, options, and quit, which the player can cycle through using the up and down arrow keys. Upon clicking enter on their chosen text, the according action is taken. If the user choses start, the game will start. If the user choses options, they will be led to an options screen where they can mute the music by clicking the m key or unmute the music by clicking the u key. To leave the options, the user needs to click backspace. When the user choses quit, the application closes. 

### Game
In my short 2D video game, the player controls a cat head sprite with either the WASD keys or the arrow keys (their choice!). They are free to move the sprite around within the confines of the screen, and when they come into contact with randomly placed objects an explosion sound effect will play and said object will disappear off screen

### Future
In the future I would love to extend the gameplay of Cat Destroy and make it even more complex with added features like timers and constantly moving objects which make it harder for the player (and by extension the cat) to destroy stuff. I could also improve on my sprites and give them each their own unique animations to make the game more lively.
